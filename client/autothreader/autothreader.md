## Use

Run `autothreader.py` from File Explorer to launch this application.

Type in the text you want to tweet. The label directly underneath the *Send tweet* button will tell you how many characters you've typed, as well as how many tweets it will take up. In the event that your text only constitutes a single tweet, it will be sent without the thread indicator.

After sending (a) tweet(s) the root tweet will be generated in the text field below the tracking label. You can use this to quickly navigate to your new thread.
